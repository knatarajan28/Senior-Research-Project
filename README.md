# Senior-Research-Project (Jan 2023 - May 2023)

# Research Objective and Hypothesis:
Aimed to understand how different growth environments, specifically using glucose and galactose as carbon sources, influence rNMP incorporation in yeast DNA.
Hypothesis: rNMP incorporation patterns would significantly differ in yeast cells grown in galactose vs glucose.

# Experimental Design and Methods:

Cell Preparation: 
-Utilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae for its close evolutionary relations to higher eukaryotes and manageable genome for genetic studies. 
-Grew yeast in different media to observe metabolic pathway impacts on DNA.
Transformation and Selection:
-Transformed yeast cells with specific markers for selection and isolating mutants for the study.
DNA and RNA Handling:
- Conducted DNA extraction, sequencing preparations, and RNA extraction for subsequent bioinformatics analysis.
Ribose-Seq: 
-Implemented a ribose-seq protocol to specifically isolate and quantify rNMPs within DNA samples, preparing them for deep sequencing.

# Data Analysis:
- Utilized a series of computational tools to analyze the sequencing data. This included handling ribose-map alignments, heatmaps, and RNA-seq data to interpret the impact of environmental changes on rNMP incorporation.
- Explored correlations between transcription activities and rNMP incorporation to assess any significant biases or patterns.

# Results:
- Identified variations in rNMP incorporation rates between different strains and environmental conditions.
- Found that mitochondrial DNA rNMP incorporation was unchanged across different conditions, suggesting a unique nuclear DNA response to environmental changes.

# Contributions to Field and Implications:
- New insights into how cellular metabolism influences genetic stability, which is crucial for understanding diseases linked to DNA replication errors.
- The findings suggest further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of rNMP incorporation and its biological implications.
